# OOP-assignment

## 📦 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

### ✅ Objective:
Create a class that represents **anything**—a **Smartphone**, a **Book**, a **Superhero**, or even your favorite snack 🍕! This assignment explores the core building blocks of OOP including constructors, attributes, methods, and inheritance.

### 🔧 Features Implemented:
- ✅ A custom class with real-world behavior and characteristics  
- ✅ A constructor (`__init__`) to initialize objects with unique data  
- ✅ Class methods to define custom actions  
- ✅ Inheritance structure to demonstrate **polymorphism** and/or **encapsulation**

### 🧪 Example Classes:
- `Superhero` with powers, gadgets, and secret identity
- `Smartphone` with brand, model, and call/text functions
- `Book` with title, author, and a method to display summary

---

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge!

### ✅ Objective:
Create a program that demonstrates **polymorphism** using animals, vehicles, or other objects. The key idea: different objects respond to the same method call (`move()`) in unique ways.

### 🔧 Features Implemented:
- ✅ Multiple classes sharing a common method name: `move()`  
- ✅ Each class defines its own unique implementation of `move()`  
- ✅ Demonstrates the essence of polymorphism: **same interface, different behavior**

### 🧪 Example Output:
```python
Car().move()     # Output: "Driving" 🚗  
Plane().move()   # Output: "Flying" ✈️  
Boat().move()    # Output: "Sailing" 🚤
